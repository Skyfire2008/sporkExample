The fewer powerups lie on the playing field(except for health powerups), the higher is the probability that another one will drop, so pick them up!
All powerups stack with each other, so don't worry about picking up two same powerups in a row, their effect will double.
This game has no overhealing, so leave those health powerups until you need them.
The outer white ring around the powerup shows the time it has until it disappears.
No matter what you've heard, turrets cannot actually pick up powerups.
Background particle effect causing motion sickness? You can set the number of particles to 0 in the pause menu.
Control scheme is uncomfortable? You can rebind those keys in the pause menu.
Settings not saving inbetween sessions? You probably need to enable third-party cookies.
Unlike regular bullets, heavy UFO missiles cannot be shot down. But they can de deflected.
Where are the heavy UFOs? Place at least 5 heavy or 25 regular turrets and find out.
Where are the shielded UFOs? Reach a multiplier of 25 and find out.
You don't need to accelerate all the time, just let your ship drift, while you correct its course and fire at nearby asteroids.
Turrets are invaluable for reaching a high multiplier.
Getting hit will reset your multiplier, so don't get hit, if you want to get a high score!
You become temporarily invincible after getting hit, use it for a quick getaway.
