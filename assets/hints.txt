The fewer powerups lie on the playing field(except for health powerups), the higher is the probability that another one will drop, so pick them up!
This game has no overhealing, so leave those health powerups until you need them.
The outer white ring around the powerup shows the time it has until it disappears.
You turrets can also pick up powerups, you can use it together with a magnet to heal or temporarily buff them.
